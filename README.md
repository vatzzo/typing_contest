# typing_contest
This application is an extension of already exisitng one at my github.
Client side was made in Angular. For the purpose of backend solution I
used Spring Boot technology. 
## Storing Data
Items of information are stored in external cloud database which is
ElephantSQL.
## Functionality
The concept of a typing game was changed into an application that allow
their users to solidify English vocabulary during the process of learning.
A user have the opportunity to provide and customize own words list.
There are 4 possibilities to be chosen. The first two are about displaying
words in English or Polish and rewriting them in the input field in the same
language either. The remaining 2 are based on usage of those 2 languages
interchangeably. The whole service is based on CRUD functionality and REST api.
